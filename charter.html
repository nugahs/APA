	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users. Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Advancement of WAI-adapt support on the web via specifications published by this group and features incorporated into other work.</li>
					<li>Improved accessibility of web technologies as measured by the activity of accessibility proponents in coordination with APA, accepted comments on specifications, and other tracked Working Group dialog;</li>
					<li>Release of Framework for Accessible Specifications as Working Group Note and indications of its use by other Working Groups;</li>
					<li>Documentation of new accessibility issues and solutions, potentially with spin-off work begun;</li>
					<li>Record of active and sustained coordination between APA and other stakeholders.</li>
				</ul>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes
					occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>
