		<h1>Personalization Task Force Work Statement</h1>
		<p>The <a href=".">Personalization Task Force</a> is a task force of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group</a>. It assists this Working Group with the work identified below.</p>
		<section id="status">
			<h2>Status</h2>
			<p>The Personalization Task Force has been transferred from the ARIA Working Group to the APA Working Group. The APA group has accepted the transfer.</p>
			<!--<p>The Personalization Task Force was <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-aria-admin/2017Aug/0006.html">approved on 14 July 2017</a> and is now active. The <a href=".">Task Force home page</a> contains information about the operation and resources of the group.</p>-->
		</section>
		<section id="objective">
			<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>The mission of the Personalization Task Force is to refine the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/">Personalization Semantics</a> specification, in consultation with the APA Working Group. The task force provides a focused forum for this work while the Working Group continues its work on APA development. Personalization Semantics was listed in the <a href="/WAI/APA/charter">APA charter</a> as "User Context" but was renamed as work progressed.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="scope">
			<h2>Scope of Work</h2>
			<p>As the nature of web technology broadens in scope and reach, and understanding of the needs of users with more types of disabilities increases through research and experience, the set of accessibility considerations for web sites becomes larger. Rather than extensively developing solutions for a wide range of users on all sites, designing sites in a way that they can be personalized to the needs of each user allows more optimal accessibility. New technologies are becoming available to provide personalized accessibility support, with assistance from semantics in web content. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/">Personalization Semantics</a> defines a set of semantic features that authors can use to support personalization of content. It is structured as an extension to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications</a>. The work descends in part from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-context/">IndieUI: User
					Context</a> but the approach in Personalization Semantics defines inline metadata in content, not user agent properties.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="approach">
			<h2>Approach</h2>
			<p>The task force will work within the APA Working Group to develop and refine Personalization Semantics. It will coordinate with other stakeholders, such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/">Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Task Force</a>, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Digital Publishing Working Group</a>, <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a>, etc. It will prepare content for Personalization Semantics 1.0, which will be reviewed and published upon approval by the APA Working Group. It may archive features for consideration in a future version in order to maintain an achievable scope for the current version.</p>
			<p>In addition to the features defined in Personalization Semantics, other work also addresses the broader topic of personalization to enhance accessibility. <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a> provides many features to allow content to adapt to aspects of the user environment; <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/">RDFa</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/">HTML Microdata</a> provide ways to add semantics to content that can aid user adaptation; some <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Accessibility Guidelines</a> can be met by enabling personalization. The task force will seek to develop a common vision for personalization approaches, coordinating with other groups as needed. The task force will engage the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to help harmonize this coordination with other accessibility activity.</p>

			<h2>Communication</h2>
			<p>Personalization Task Force communications and discussions are visible to the public. The <a href=".">task force home page</a> details communication mechanisms in use. The task force will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Support synchronous (e.g., teleconferences, face-to-face meetings) and asynchronous (e.g., mailing list discussions, issue trackers, wiki, surveys, etc.) methods of communication;</li>
				<li>Use the procedures of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/decision-policy">APA Working Group Decision Policy</a> to make decisions;</li>
				<li>Provide updates and feedback to APA Working Group teleconferences, as appropriate. These liaisons are primarily the responsibility of the Personalization Task Force Facilitators;</li>
				<li>Maintain information resulting from its activities (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) on the <a href=".">Personalization Task Force home page</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="participation">
			<h2>Participation</h2>
			<p>Any participant in the APA Working Group may participate in the Personalization Task Force. Participants should expect to dedicate 2 to 4 hours per week for Personalization Task Force work, which is considered part of the overall work commitment to the APA Working Group: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Remain current on the Personalization Task Force mailing list and respond to postings in a timely manner; </li>
				<li>Provide feedback to editors of specifications via email or by filing bugs; </li>
				<li>Participate in weekly Personalization Task Force teleconferences, or send regrets to the Personalization Task Force mailing list. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Participants may also join Personalization Task Force sub-groups. Sub-groups take on specific assignments for the Personalization Task Force. </p>
			<p>If you are interested in becoming a participant of the Personalization Task Force or have any questions regarding its work, contact the task force facilitators. </p>
